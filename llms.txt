# vipunen

`vipunen` is a client package for [Vipunen](https://vipunen.fi/en-gb/),
the education administration’s reporting portal. The Ministry of
Education and Culture and the Finnish National Agency for Education are
jointly responsible for the content on Vipunen, but have nothing to do
with this R package.

Statistical data from Vipunen is also machine readable through a
REST/JSON API. The API was opened in August 2017 and is currently still
in development phase. In this first phase, the content is moslty related
to the data collected from universities.
